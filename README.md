# naive-bayes-spam-classifier
This project demonstrates a complete SMS spam classification system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It walks through text preprocessing, Bag of Words implementation from scratch, Naive Bayes probability math, and a final scikit-learn implementation for comparison. Ideal for educational purposes and understanding the math behind spam detection.
